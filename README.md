# Customer Lifetime Value Prediction

This project predicts the lifetime value (LTV) of customers using transactional data and machine learning.

ðŸ§  We use RFM features (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) and AOV (Average Order Value) to train an XGBoost regression model that estimates how much value a customer will generate.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, XGBoost, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Power BI (for dashboard)
- Dataset: Online Retail (UCI)

## ðŸš€ Project Workflow

- Cleaned and preprocessed e-commerce data
- Engineered RFM & AOV features
- Trained an XGBoost model to predict LTV
- Exported predictions to CSV
- Built a Power BI dashboard to visualize:
  - Top customers
  - LTV distribution
  - Average KPIs (LTV, Frequency, Recency, AOV)

## ðŸ“Š Dashboard

Power BI report includes:

- Bar chart of top LTV customers
- LTV distribution histogram
- KPI cards
- Segment-based slicer (High / Medium / Low)
